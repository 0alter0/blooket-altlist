# blooket-altlist

Blooket altlist is just a moderatly big list of blooket accounts, I'll update these every now and then.

# FAQ (no one asks these, but I wanna clear up questions)

Q:How are you doing this?
A:That's the secret.

Q:Is this against Blooket TOS?
A:Yes, don't get mad at me if these alts get banned.

Q:Can you make the accounts have (number) coins?
A:No, just wait 24 hours because I will dump 500+ tokens in the accounts everyday.

Q:Can you make the accounts have all the blooks?
A:Would've already been done, but you can use Blooket Cheats to locally give all them to yourself.

Q:Can you make me an account personally?
A:No, just wait for the accounts to be added. 

Q:Can you buy titles/backgrounds per account?
A:No, it would clutter up the alt list too much and doesn't really matter, buy them yourself on them.

Q:Can you make an alt for (game)
A:No.

Q:What are premium alts?
A:Premium alts are alts that have 1000+ tokens and at least 10 blooks.

Q:What are maxed alts?
A:Maxed alts are alts that have either a full set (not including chromas), muliple full sets (not including chromas), or every blook (maybe a chroma).


# Future Plans:

1. Add premium alts (Just alts that will be stacked with 1000+ tokens and at least 10 blooks.)
2. Maybe make a website that auto generates these.


# Current Status:

Continued due to new ways to get daily rewards. THERE IS CURRENTLY A GLITCH WHERE YOU CANNOT SEE THE ACTUAL LEVELS!
