# blooket-altlist

Blooket altlist is just a moderatly big list of blooket accounts, I'll update these every now and then.

If it's better for you, we've made a [site](https://blooket-alts.glitch.me) (inspired by Blooket Bot by Duck Life, their discord is on the site.)

# FAQ (no one asks these, but I wanna clear up questions)

<details>
  <summary><strong>How are you doing this?</strong></summary>
  That's the secret.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Is this against Blooket TOS?</strong></summary>
  Yes, don't get mad at me if these alts get banned.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can you make the accounts have (number) coins?</strong></summary>
  No, just wait 24 hours because I will dump 500+ tokens in the accounts every day.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can you make the accounts have all the blooks?</strong></summary>
  Would've already been done, but you can use Blooket Cheats to locally give all them to yourself.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can you make me an account personally?</strong></summary>
  No, just wait for the accounts to be added.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Can you buy titles/backgrounds per account?</strong></summary>
  No, it would clutter up the alt list too much and doesn't really matter, buy them yourself on them.
</details>

  No.
</details>

<details>

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What are maxed alts?</strong></summary>
